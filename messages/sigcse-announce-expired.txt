Dear SIGCSE-announce subscriber,

We are in the midst of cleaning up the SIGCSE-announce mailing list.  You currently receive messages from that list at the address <_EMAIL_>.  SIGCSE policies indicate that only current members of SIGCSE should receive that mailing list [1].  Unfortunately, ACM records seem to indicate that your SIGCSE membership expired on _EXPIRATION_.  

In early July, we plan to remove any expired members from the mailing list.  If you would like to remain on the SIGCSE-announce mailing list, please renew your membership by the end of June.  If you are still a member of SIGCSE, please send me your membership number so that I can check with ACM.  If you have questions, feel free to contact me.

Regards,

-- SamR

p.s. If you are also subscribed to the SIGCSE-members mailing list, you may also receive a similar message for that list.
