Dear SIGCSE-announce subscriber,

We are in the midst of cleaning up the SIGCSE-announce mailing list.  You currently receive messages from that list at the address <_EMAIL_>.  SIGCSE policies indicate that only current members of SIGCSE should receive that mailing list [1].  Unfortunately, ACM records do not include an active SIGCSE membership that matches your email address.

In early July, we plan to remove any recipients without active SIGCSE memberships from the mailing list.  If you have a SIGCSE membership under a separate email address, please let me know that email address or your ACM account number.  If you do not currently have a SIGCSE membership, I would encourage you to join or rejoin.  Information is available on the SIGCSE membership page [2].  If you have questions, feel free to contact me.

Regards,

-- SamR

p.s. If you are also subscribed to the SIGCSE-members mailing list, you may also receive a similar message for that list.
